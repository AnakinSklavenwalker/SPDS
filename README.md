# WPDS

<!--[![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/5a2536b9cf141c0700b92668/badge?branch=master)](https://app.shippable.com/github/johspaeth/WPDS) -->

This repository contains a Java implementation of Weighted Pushdown Systems.
Additionally, it contains an implementation of [Boomerang](boomerangPDS) and [IDEal](idealPDS) based on a Weighted Pushdown System.

# Build

All projects are maven projects and can be imported in any IDE. 
To build the projects and execute the test cases, run

``mvn clean test``

# Examples

Boomerang code examples can be found [here](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/WPDS/blob/master/boomerangPDS/src/main/java/boomerang/example/ExampleMain.java). Code examples for IDEal are given [here](https://github.com/CROSSINGTUD/WPDS/tree/master/idealPDS/src/main/java/inference/example).


# Notes on the Test Cases

The projects Boomerang and IDEal contain JUnit test suites. As for JUnit, the test methods are annotated with @Test and can be run as normal JUnit tests.
However, these methods are *not* executed but only statically analyzed. When one executes the JUnit tests, the test method bodies are supplied as input to Soot 
and a static analysis is triggered. All this happens in JUnit's @Before test time. The test method itself is never run, may throw NullPointerExceptions or may not even terminate.

If the static analysis succeeded, JUnit will officially label the test method as skipped. However, the test will not be labeled as Error or Failure. 
Even though the test was skipped, it succeeded. Note, JUnit outputs a message:

``org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException: got: <false>, expected: is <true>``

This is ok! The test passed!
